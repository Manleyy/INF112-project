## Project Ideas

### Idee 1: Tower Defence (with map creator if possible)

- Inspired by Balloons tower defence but can involve any theme, not necessarily "Balloons".
- Different maps and designs for "monkeys" and "balloons".
- Various "monkeys" that perform different actions (basic-attacker, flame-attacker for damage over time, ice-attacker for slowness).
- Includes lives that are affected if balloons reach the end.
- Multiple levels with 1, 2, or 3 paths from which balloons can emerge.
- A map creator that allows players to create their own maps.

### Idee 2: A Platformer

- Inspired by Mario, Super Meat Boy, etc.
- A platformer with obstacle courses, "power-ups", and enemies that can damage you (take lives).
- Different levels that a player must complete to advance to the next.

### Specific Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Egor

- **Strengths:**
  - Has control over most parts of "MVC" (Model-View-Controller).
  - Good at reading and understanding how code is structured and functions.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Struggles with implementing tests and understanding how a test should test specific things in the code.
  - Finds it difficult to start coding.

#### William

- **Strengths:**
  - Feels most comfortable with both the model and controller in "MVC", enjoys back-end coding.
  - Likes testing the code.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Does not enjoy front-end development as much.

#### Tarjei

- **Strengths:**
  - Has most control over "controllers" and how they communicate with the rest of the code in a Model-View-Controller setup.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Struggles with creativity in coming up with different ideas to solve complex problems.

#### Trym

- **Strengths:**
  - Finds thinking outside the box with different data structures exciting, which opens up possibilities for optimization in the project.
  - Enjoys testing the security of applications, which can be beneficial when testing the game for bugs.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Finds it difficult to start large coding projects.
  - Tends to seek inspiration from sources when stuck, instead of allowing for extended problem-solving.

#### Kevin

- **Strengths:**
  - A big fan of design, UI, and generally the frontend aspect of programs and systems. Feels that he has an eye for such things and manages well to convey the program's theme to the user in a nice way that has "flow".
- **Weaknesses:**
  - May struggle a bit at the start of a project, but once the idea for a certain solution has hit, everything is fine and dandy. Struggles somewhat with creating tests.
