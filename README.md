## Project Ideas

### Idee 1: Tower Defence (with map creator if possible)

- Inspired by Balloons tower defence but can involve any theme, not necessarily "Balloons".
- Different maps and designs for "monkeys" and "balloons".
- Various "monkeys" that perform different actions (basic-attacker, flame-attacker for damage over time, ice-attacker for slowness).
- Includes lives that are affected if balloons reach the end.
- Multiple levels with 1, 2, or 3 paths from which balloons can emerge.
- A map creator that allows players to create their own maps.

### Idee 2: A Platformer

- Inspired by Mario, Super Meat Boy, etc.
- A platformer with obstacle courses, "power-ups", and enemies that can damage you (take lives).
- Different levels that a player must complete to advance to the next.
